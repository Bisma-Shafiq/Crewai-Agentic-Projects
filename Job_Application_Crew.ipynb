Focus on quantifiable results whenever possible (e.g., accuracy improvements, efficiency gains, etc.). If a project is incomplete or unclear, mention that explicitly. The output should be a structured format, like a JSON or a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a project with keys like 'project_name', 'description', 'technologies', 'results'.
